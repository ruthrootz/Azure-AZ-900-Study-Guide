# AZ-900: Describe Cloud Concepts (15-20%)

## Describe the benefits and considerations of using cloud services

* Describe terms such as:
    * [High Availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/availability)
        - not likely your app becomes unavailable because of high SLA and resource redundancy
    * Scalability
        - up your CPU processing power, data storage whenever necessary
    * [Elasticity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/)
        - scale up or scale down as needed
        - pay for what you use
    * Agility
        - quickly deploy new resources
    * Fault Tolerance
        - use redundancy to keep your data and apps safe from local disasters or server/datacenter failures
    * [Disaster Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview)
        - use automatic backups to get back up and running after a failure
* Describe the Principles of Economies of Scale [(PDF)](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/e/4/6e4cb3d1-5004-4024-8d90-6c66c83c17aa/the_economics_of_the_cloud_white_paper.pdf)
* Describe the differences between:
    * Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
    * Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
* Describe the consumption-based model

## Describe the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

* Describe [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-paas/)
* Describe [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-saas/)
* Describe [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-iaas/)
* [Compare and contrast the 3 different service types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/types-of-cloud-computing/)

## Describe the differences between Public, Private and Hybrid cloud models

* Describe [Public cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/)
* Describe [Private cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/)
* Describe [Hybrid cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/)
